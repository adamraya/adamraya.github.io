<p class="lead">My name is <span itemprop="name">Adam Raya</span>, I am a <span itemprop="title">Computer Engineer</span> who loves using technology to create and evolve solutions.</p>

<p>I have more than five years of experience providing <span itemprop="affiliation">freelance</span> front and backend development services for consumer web applications.</p>

<p>On the backend, I've been working with a LAMP stack, using frameworks like Symfony2 and Yii. I also enjoy working with Google's App Engine, focusing on Java, GWT and Datastore.</p>

<p>On the frontend, I've worked extensively with Javascript, JQuery, AngularJS, Bootstrap, and SASS for styling, using tools like Gulp for automation. I also use Git for version control, as well as Maven for dependencies and JUnit for test in my Java projects.</p>

<p>Beyond the tools I mentioned above, I work with quite a few CMSs as well, like <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank" onclick="trackOutboundLink('https://wordpress.org/'); return false;">Wordpress</a>, <a href=" https://www.drupal.org" target="_blank" onclick="trackOutboundLink('https://www.drupal.org'); return false;">Drupal</a>, <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/" target="_blank" onclick="trackOutboundLink('http://www.magentocommerce.com/'); return false;">Magento</a>, <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/" target="_blank" onclick="trackOutboundLink('https://www.prestashop.com/'); return false;">Prestashop</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/" target="_blank" onclick="trackOutboundLink('https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/'); return false;">WooCommerce</a>. Working with these CMSs composes much of my freelance work, which is carefully managed using agile methodologies.</p>

<p>When I take on projects, I engage with them as if they were my own, regardless of the client. This means that the end product not only meets, but exceeds the project requirements, no matter what.</p>

<p>I've done simple development on Mobile applications, testing platforms like Android, iOS and FirefoxOS.</p>

<p>I am deeply interested in Artificial Intelligence, Geolocation and UI/UX.</p>
